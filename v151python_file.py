# OpenCV- Introduction
# Opencv is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
# Now, it plays a major role in real-time operation which is very important in todayâ€™s systems. By using it, 
# one can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human.
